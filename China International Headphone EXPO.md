This post recounts my experiences and interviews during the China International Headphone Expo (CIHE) in Guangzhou, tailored for audiophiles interested in HiFi industry. It bridges the information gap between manufacturers and consumers by offering insights rarely known to the general public. The order of manufacturers is arranged in **ascending order** of their influence.

# Hongshu Audio / Binary Acoustics

Hongshu Audio currently offers only one product: the EH1, a full-size electrostatic headphone **priced around 3,000 RMB**, complete with a simple electrostatic amplifier. It's almost always being out of stock. You find some introductions about it here: [_Introducing Four Major Diy Headphones Workshop in China_](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1dqy10m/introducing_four_major_diy_headphones_workshop_in). At the booth of Binary Acoustics, I was surprised to see the EH1 demo unit, which revealed that Binary Acoustics and Hongshu Audio are essentially two brands of one company. As a decent brand rather than a DIY workshop, R&D of Hongshu's electrostatic headphone system is likely supported financially by Binary Acoustics's profit.

When paired with the included amp which barely powers the headphones, I tested the EH1 and noticed an exceptionally flat frequency response in ten seconds. The sound closely adhered to the Harman over-ear 2018 while the bass was a bit lighter. The booth owner confirmed my impressions matched objective measurements. **When subjective perception aligns with objective frequency response, a headphone likely has low nonlinearity**, meaning it delivers Hi-Fi low-distortion sound that's audibly exceptional. The EH1 didn't just impress me with its sound but also its super light weight and stylish ID. Achieving this level of quality for electrostatic headphones at such a cost is remarkable.

Previously, a few overseas audiophiles on Reddit had consulted me about purchasing an EH1. I dissuaded them due to stock shortages and early batches suffering from reliability issues like crackling and channel imbalance. However, the latest EH1 batch is reportedly the finalized version with greatly improved stability. Since overseas aftersales services are expensive and time-consuming, Hongshu wouldn't dare export unless the EH1's durability met high standards. **The EH1's final stable version will launch by year-end**, so stay tuned.

Post-expo, I learned Hongshu is planning to release two more products: the EHA2T electrostatic amp and the EH2 electrostatic headphone, targeted for release in Q2 and Q4 of 2025, priced at approximately 4,000 RMB and 10,000 RMB, respectively. CTO of Hongshu admitted that the EH2 will not offer stellar value for money, but claimed to try their best effort to use premium materials in every possible way to ensure buyers don't feel disappointed.

"EH2 priced 10,000 RMB just because we need a 10,000 RMB flagship headphone. I'll do my best not to make my customers feel disappointed. Of course it's too expensive. I'm not happy with the price either."

As for me, I'm set on getting myself an EH1 but might consider using Topping's electrostatic amp instead of the stock unit.

# Sonic Memory

Sonic Memory's recent product, the G50, is a closed-back monitor headphone priced at 299 RMB. It has garnered widespread acclaim and consistently sells out. Initially, I was skeptical that an unheard-of brand could produce a competent full-size headphone at such a low price, but a demo at the expo completely dispelled my doubts. The G50 offers excellent isolation and neutral, accurate sound reproduction. Its only flaw is its somewhat small pads which might feel tight for larger ears. The G50 also features a locking mechanism on its 3.5mm AUX interface, a simple yet secure design that prevents accidental disconnections and keeps the attached microphone firmly in place. Usability is most important in the world of monitor headphones.

The boss of Sonic Memory, nicknamed Dogwhip, explained that they not only produces its own brand but also offers B2B solutions, enabling strong cost control and R&D capabilities. In Dogwhip's words:
"Other manufacturers might struggle to profit from a 299 RMB headphone with G50's quality, but we still ensure reasonable margins... We even developed private molds for G50, investing several hundred thousand
upfront, something small brands wouldn't dare risk. Many brands test the waters with off-the-shelf molds, producing a few dozen units at a time to minimize risk... **Some, including more influencing iem brands, even lack proper acoustic R&D facilities**... For G50, maybe we could sell the mold to those interested... Exporting? We'll surely consider exporting only if domestic demand is met. We significantly underestimated the G50's sales. It sold out very soon despite minimal marketing..."

Dogwhip also elaborated on G50's design, particularly its impressive passive isolation. The headphone achieves this through a fully sealed cup and non-perforated pads. Designing a high-fidelity closed-back headphone is harder because sound wave reflections can damage sound quality. Other similiar products, like FiiO JT1 and HarmonicDyne Black Hole, implement venting to mitigate these issues. Sonic Memory, however, opted for a fully sealed design, carefully selecting materials for the rear chamber cover to optimize acoustic properties. Despite the challenges, G50 boasts an impressively warranty rate.

When asked about future planar headphone plans, Dogwhip revealed they have the capability to produce planar headphones but won't pursue this category for now, as he believes planar headphones have yet to match the "correct" listening experience of dynamic headphones (I disagree with that). Dogwhip also showcased an upcoming product, the GO50, priced at 399 RMB, which features a rotating rear cover to switch between open-back and closed-back modes. There's also a dynamic headphone with wooden cups in development.

Interestingly, I stumbled upon Dogwhip discussing Bluetooth headphones with another audiophile. He showcased a Beats Studio Pro, commending its imaging and sound quality over Sony's XM5, despite its shitty ANC performance. Curious, I asked him whether brands like Bose, Sony, and Apple genuinely hold a competitive edge in flagship ANC Bluetooth headphones or simply leverage their branding to justify higher prices.
"Unfortunately, there is a genuine technological barrier", Dogwhip explained, "Take Apple's AirPods Max ANC chip, it's on par with the scale of the iPhone 4 soc. Even most smartphone manufacturers lack the capability to design something comparable. Domestic brands, meanwhile, rely on Qualcomm's solutions, which, while decent, are nowhere near the level of the Big Three. For now, Sonic Memory has no plans to enter the Bluetooth headphone market."

Sonic Memory's booth was full of fascinating info. **Many thanks to Dogwhip for sharing insights typically reserved for industry insiders.** Transparent communication like this contributes to healthier competition and a better-informed consumer base.

# Fosi Audio / MEMORITAI

![Fosi](./assets/fosi.jpg)

I first encountered Fosi Audio at Shenzhen Internal Audio Show (SIAS) in September. However, their representatives at the time were from the marketing department, while I was more interested in technical aspects, so our exchange was limited. After the event, I visited Fosi's headquarters in Shenzhen to learn more about their product roadmap, pricing strategy, and marketing plans. I'll only tell something that I wasn't asked for confidentiality.

![i5](./assets/i5%20k7.jpg)

At CIHE, Fosi showcased the prototype of their planar magnetic headphone, the i5, for the second time. Initially, I mistook it for a product from Ori Sonic 初心之声 (a Chinese headphone workshop that relies on China National Graphene Innovation Center, I'll introduce at the end of this post) due to their strikingly similar design, and thought Fosi may be an agent of Ori Sonic.

Upon clarification, it turns out that Ori Sonic developed a high-performance planar driver, which was sold to Fosi after Chuxin decided against mass production. Fosi then built their first planar magnetic headphone, the i5, around this driver. While the demo units had minor issues, the overall sound leaned towards a neutral and low-distortion tuning, which I appreciated.

Fosi also unveiled their latest flagship product: the K7, a desktop DAC/amp priced at 1,099 RMB. Though its design resembles a gaming sound card, its core audience remains audiophiles, with sound performance prioritized above all else. The K7 even includes mic input and controls, catering to HiFi and gaming enthusiasts alike. Many distributors expressed interest in the K7 at the expo, but its production capacity is reportedly limited for now, so marketing efforts have been minimal.

Fosi also operates a high-end sub-brand, MEMORITAI, which currently offers the Euphony—a single-ended pure headphone amp priced at 10,000 RMB. While its chrome-plated mirror finish and intricate circuitry are impressive, I personally think the product represents an inefficient use of R&D and mold investment.

Overall, Fosi is poised to become a significant force in the global HiFi scene. Their excellent cost control, robust R&D capabilities, and professional marketing approach position them as a formidable competitor. With plans to diversify into CD players, operational amplifiers, and other components, Fosi is receiving rare acclaim from both new audiophiles and seasoned veterans alike. However, their understanding of market demands could improve, and their newly hired product manager may address this gap.
